    "# Parsing charter books\n",
    "\n",
    "The charter books of Holland and Zeeland have been scanned and OCR'ed and made available at the page level. This Jupyter Notebook contains code to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- make the text available at the charter level, such that users can jump to specific charters in stead of specific pages,\n",
    "- identify which places are attested in a charter,\n",
    "- identify in which year or period a charter was written,\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploitable structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- pages have headers with charter number and year or year and charter number\n",
    "- charters are numbered in ascending order\n",
    "- charters have dates in ascending order\n",
    "- line numbers switch sides on alternating pages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues of preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- lines are not properly split\n",
    "- several words are recognised as lists of individual characters separated by whitespace\n",
    "- several words are split over lines with first page followed by linebreak\n",
    "- margins contain line numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- identify charter titles\n",
    "- identify charter years\n",
    "- identify place names mentioned in charters\n",
    "- identify language of charter text paragraphs (Latin, Middle Dutch, Modern Dutch, French, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the OCR'ed text on the [resources.huygens.knaw.nl](http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/ohz/#page=0&accessor=toc&view=homePane) website was used, but it has issues with whitespacing within words (i.e. many words are split into whitespaced individual characters), which is difficult to resolve for sequences of words, e.g. \"l o c u m E p t e r n a c u m\" instead of \"locum Epternacum\" (OHZ part 1, page 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the HTML formatted OCR output of a new OCR using Tesseract was used. Besides solving the issue with whitespacing, it seems to have slightly better recognition in that numbers are more often recognized correctly, which is important for identifying charter numbers and dates. \n",

    "modern_dutch_text = \"De tekstoverlevering van deze oorkonde is niet bijzonder goed. Poncelet (a.w., p. 166) neemt aan, dat de drukken alle direct of indirect zijn afgeleid van het oudst bekende afschrift B. Zeer waarschijnlijk staat ook geen der overige afschriften los van B. Enkele corrupte plaatsen in B zijn reeds door anderen ge?mendeerd. Het ge?mendeerde plaatsen wij tussen rechte haken. Dit staat los van de vraag naar de echtheid van deze oorkonde. Zij ts voor het eerst gesteld door J. Mabillon (Acta Sanctorum ordinis sancti Benedicti, saec. IIL-t, Lut. Paris. 1672, p. 629). Mabillon zelf heeft haar onbeantwoord gelaten. Geen belang heeft thans nog de kritiek op deze oorkonde uitgebracht door P. P. M. Alberdingk Thijm (De H. Willibrordus apostel der Nederlanden, Amsterdam-Leuven 1661, p. 255-257; vgl. de vertaling door L. Tross, Der heilige Willibrord, M?nster[W. 1863, p. 180, noot 2). Later is deze kritiek uitgewerkt door L. van der Essen in: Geschiedkundige Bladen, I-2, Amsterdam 1905, p. 378-382, waar Diederik van Echternach wordt voorgesteld als de vervaardiger circa 11Q0 van deze oorkonde. Kort nadien evenwel heeft Van der Essen deze hypothese weer ingetrokken, daartoe genoopt door de kritiek die hij had ontmoet bij A. Poncelet (a.w., p. 163-174; vgl. W. Levison, in: MGH, SS rer. Merov., VILT, p. gr, noot 9). Poncelet resumeerde zijn oordeel over de oorkonde, het testamentum van Willibrord, aldus:  Tout compte fait, s?il n'est peut-?tre pas sage de se prononcer r?solument pour Dauthenticit? du ?testament de S. Willibrord, il semble infiniment moins prudent encore de le ranger parmi les documents apocryphes.                                  | Er is geen reden om er aan te twijfelen dat Willibrord in het zesde jaar van koning Diederik TV een aantal bij missionering verworven bezittingen met een oorkonde zou hebben geschonken aan het klooster te Echternach, en dat de tekst van deze oorkonde bewaard is gebleven. Dit neemt niet weg, dat deze tekst in de enige ons bewaard gebleven versie bij nadere beschouwing een gewichtige interpolatie bevat, namelijk de passage waaruit moet blijken dat Willibrord, behalve bezittingen afkomstig van een aantal ingenui Franci, aan Echternach ook goederen heeft geschonken, die hij had ontvangen van de familie der Pippiniden. Wat Wampach (a.w., Le, p. go vig. ) hierover ook moge gezegd hebben, het blijft een feit dat deze passage op onhandige wijze een contekst verstoort, die bovendien verderop met de inhoud van deze toch belangrijke inlas weer geen rekening houdt.
